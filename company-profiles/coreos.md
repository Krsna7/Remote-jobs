CoreOS is a part of Red Hat.
We develop open source tools that are the fundamental building blocks of modern distributed systems. Our open source components continue to be freely used and developed to power cloud native distributed systems. Projects like etcd (distributed key-value store), Container Linux (lightweight container-centric OS), Kubernetes (container orchestrator), Prometheus (container monitoring system), and more continued to be developed by our team as a part of Red Hat, the largest open source software company in the world.

# ALICE

## Company blurb

ALICE is a hospitality operations platform for all staff communication and guest requests.

By joining all of the departments of a hotel with a single operations platform for internal communication and task management, ALICE helps the staff act as a team to provide consistently excellent service.

ALICE’s main product - ALICE Suite - brings together front office, concierge, housekeeping, and maintenance teams, and connects guests to hotel with our app and text messaging tools.

The ALICE platform is also available as specialized software and mobile applications for the hotel staff (ALICE Staff), concierge (ALICE Concierge) and guests (ALICE Guest).

ALICE’s partners include 3-5 star independent and managed hotels, hotel groups, residential condominiums, serviced apartments, vacation rental companies, and concierge companies looking to provide exceptional service through mobile staff technology and guest communication channels.

## Company size

130+ team members, ~70 in the tech division

## Remote status

We're a team of people currently living and working remotely in 16 countries, 68 cities.

We believe that great work can happen anywhere in the world. One of the biggest challenges is for companies to find strong talent when they are limited to hiring in cities where they have a physical footprint. We feel that incredible talent exists globally that are aligned with our values and are interested in the problems we are trying to solve.

We have a very strong remote culture and are always trying to find ways to foster that culture without being limited by the remote nature of our team. We encourage video calls, to be able to see each other when working together, and are constantly finding ways to get people [virtually] together for non-work conversations (i.e.: Cyber Coffee, Book Club, among others)

When I joined ALICE I was expecting to feel more siloed or disconnected from the rest of the team, but in reality at ALICE you are always on video calls and chatting via Slack with other team members. It doesn’t feel like you’re siloed or disconnected at all.

We also try to get our teams together physically at least once a year, because face-to-face helps build bonds that are very hard to build (not impossible) when you communicate over a video call.

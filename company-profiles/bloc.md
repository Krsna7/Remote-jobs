## Company blurb

Founded in 2012, Bloc was one of the world’s first bootcamps and the first to be 100% online. Since then we’ve helped thousands of students achieve their goals. We believe in leveraging technology to deliver an immersive outcomes-focused program. Rather than a traditional classroom, we employ a flipped classroom, mastery learning approach where you will work with a team of experienced developers invested in your success. 

Our mission: help everyone pursue their craft and improve their lives. Bloc is an online education company with intensive mentor-led programs for aspiring developers and designers. We combine skilled mentors and project-based curriculum to offer students around the world a more accessible and effective alternative to traditional degrees. We’re in the business of changing people’s careers through code and design. We offer structured, online training programs in software development and design. Our web development and designer track are designed for beginners and focused on outcomes.

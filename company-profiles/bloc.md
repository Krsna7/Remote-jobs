## Remote status

Create a new routine, collaborate with your office fam, and continue to put out your best work — even from home.
Keep in touch with your office fam on a personal level. When you’re all working from home, you’ll have to make a concerted effort to keep the casual convos going — especially now, when you’re all dealing with very new circumstances. Set up Slack channels dedicated to sharing pics of your pets, Spotify playlists and healthy lunch recipes. You can even schedule weekly calls where you strictly chat about non-work stuff.
Block out times on your calendar for breaks and deep thinking. Erin Rosenblatt, VP of Education Operations, advises: “get used to over-communicating. Let your teams know if you are going to be heads down on a project for a while and not responding to messages. Block off time for lunch or doctors appointments on your work calendar so that people can see when you aren’t available.” This gives you the freedom to step away and not feel like you’re on call 24/7.
Don’t just attend virtual meetings: participate. In a conference room, everyone can see that you’re present and engaged. That’s not necessarily the case in virtual meetings. Keep your camera on. In larger meetings, most of you will keep your microphone on mute (which is a good best practice). Un-mute at least once, even if you’re not asked a question directly. Affirm someone’s idea, or go ahead and voice that question.
Comment in chat threads. Some of us are less compelled to communicate through writing, but a comment here and there makes a huge difference in the world of remote working. Even a short response or emoji shows the rest of your team that someone’s out there listening.
Reach out to other departments. Ivy Rueb, Community Manager, learned that she had to keep reaching out to other departments, especially when you’re not running into them in the kitchenette anymore. “You can be deep in a project and forget to get feedback or not check with other teams to make sure that what you are working on aligns with their goals. It is better to continue getting feedback along the way so you don’t have to go back and redo the work.

## Remote status

<b>The Vox Media site does not specifically state any policies on remote work. However, they include the following message about work/life balance.</b>

<blockquote>Vox Media employees are smart, passionate, hard-working, and accomplished professionals who also strive for a healthy work/life fit. While we sometimes log late hours, we know that everyone needs to rest and recharge.

We recognize that your personal commitments don't end when you start work for the day. We offer flexible arrangements depending on job responsibilities, generous paid time off, and expansive parental leave benefits â€” both to ensure that employees can arrange their workdays for maximum productivity and to allow time for tending to family and personal responsibilities.</blockquote>

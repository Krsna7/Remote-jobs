## Company blurb
[&yet](https://andyet.com) is about people. We’re known as a design and development consultancy (specializing in Node, React, and realtime), but we don’t fit neatly in a box.

We design and [develop custom software](https://andyet.com/software) for web, mobile, desktop, chat, and voice.

We enable millions of people to make super simple video calls with [Talky](https://talky.io).

We pioneer software and standards for [realtime communications](https://andyet.com/realtime).

We [wrote the book](https://gatherthepeople.com) on taking a human approach to marketing for people who would rather make what they love than persuade people to buy it.

We create high-impact conference experiences such as [RealtimeConf](http://experience.realtimeconf.com) and more recently–[&yetConf](http://andyetconf.com).

## Company size
20+

## Remote status
We employ several strategies that ensure inclusive and collaborative environment for all employees. To communicate we use Slack (text-chat), our own [Talky](https://talky.io) (video chat and meetings), [Twist](https://twistapp.com) (daily check-ins) and Github (organisation wide discussions). One-on-ones and bi-weekly company-wide updates are crucial part of not only staying connected but also understanding process, structure as well as employees' wellbeing. Furthermore, at least once per year we organize an all-hands team week.

## Region

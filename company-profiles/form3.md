# Form3

## Company blurb

Form3 develop payment technology. We offer a fully managed, payment technology platform for Financial Institutions as-a-Service.

Our vision is to be the worlds most trusted provider of payment technology.

We design, build and run the technology that powers the future of payments.

Historically, banking leaders believed that infrastructure technologies were an asset for their financial institution because they were managed locally and could be customised. Form3 is changing this model and offering payments infrastructure as a service. A fully cloud native platform that is fully managed to lower costs across operations, infrastructure, security, upgrades, and change management.

Form3 has proven that there is a cheaper, simpler, and more efficient way for FI's to handle large payment volumes and scale dynamically without a heavy infrastructure burden. 

We enable FI’s to benefit from the flexibility, business agility and speed to market that an API-first platform brings along with embedded services that ensure they are always future-ready.

Form3 work with regulated financial institutions including large Enterprise banks and digital challenger banks including Mastercard, Lloyds Banking Group, Ebury, LHV, PPS, N26, Square, Ziglu, Aion Bank and others. 

Form3's payments platform powers around 10% of all UK Faster Payments equating to around 500m transactions a year - approx £175bn 
We also provide single API connectivity to the universe of payment schemes including the full SEPA suite for European Banks.

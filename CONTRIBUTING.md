# Contributing to Remote-friendly Jobs

Thanks for showing interest in our project! We want any contributions you can bring, large or small. Please see what we want and how to contribute below.

## What we want

### New companies

If you know any companies who are remote-friendly or semi-remote, please add them to the list!

### Information on existing companies

Some company names have a âš  icon next to them. This icon means we don't have much information about this company yet, and we would love a contribution! See each individual company profile for details.

## How to contribute

If you would like to contribute, please fork the repository. Forking creates a copy on your account to edit freely. Once you make any desired edits, submit a pull request to potentially add them here!

Thanks for contributing to our project!
